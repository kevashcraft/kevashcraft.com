  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my website! I'm Kevin Ashcraft, a computer programmer and amateur radio operator in Auburndale, Florida.
    <br>
    You can find some of my code on <a href="https://github.com/kevashcraft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>, and some of my mania on <a href="https://twitter.com/kevashcraft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>.

  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>
    This is the 10th time, at least, that I've made this website. Learning something new, trying to beat Google's Page Speed test, getting busy with a paying project, all have caused previous iterations to be fatal. So this time I'm working with a new premise: start small and increase momentum.
    <br>
    This is a basic one-page setup built with my favorite tools (for now) and we'll see if I get the time to come back and add in the blog, some images, and a bit of js.
    <br>
    Until next time, have a cool day and thanks for stopping by the site.
  </p>
